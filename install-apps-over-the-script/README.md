## Install Apps over the Script
- a script that can be used to install desired apps and *.deb packages at once, including setting the hostname for the linux instance (adjust the desired values in the script)

#### tested on linuxmint 22.0 (based on ubuntu 24.04)
A direct application on ubuntu itself (e.g. Ubuntu desktop or lubuntu desktop or similar) is neither tested nor guaranteed that this script has been optimized for linux mint.
